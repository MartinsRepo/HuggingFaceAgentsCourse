* Why I made this repo?
    + Running the Colab Version with LLM's from HuggingFace, I got always the message: "You have exceeded your monthly included credits for Inference Providers. Subscribe to PRO to get 20x more monthly included credits." Only for the training, I don't want to pay 9$/m.
    + For this reason, we are using the Openai-Api with the model "gpt-4o-mini"
    + I prefere a local implementation using VSCode

## Setup

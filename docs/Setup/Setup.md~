# Installation in Ubuntu
## 1. Prerequisites
**(a) Python Version used:** 3.12.9

**(b) VENV aktivieren**
A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments. Here **conda** is used.
We will generate different **venv**s for every subproject.

* Subprojects stored in the folder **notebooks** are:
    + smolAgents
    + llamaIndexAgents

> cd notebooks/<subproject>

> conda create --name venv python=3.12.9

> sconda activate venv
